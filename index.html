                The day my life changed forever. I still remember how you smiled and my heart skipped a beat, it was love at first sight. From that moment, I knew you were someone special.
                
                Every time I watch this video, it takes me back to that day. You looked so beautiful and I was so nervous that didn't know what to say (until I got lil drunk) after that well you already know 😉.

                This was our first offical date together, I mean we weren't alone but still I think it counts. We were still in that phase of being comfortable with each other but still very shy.
                
                I remember you were lost and we had to wait for you (like always 🙄) and even when taking photos we both were shy. Then we went to the restaurant and had food and drinks and you held my hand and we looked into each other eyes and had our first kiss. This day was also when KC's Bar ko uk 😜 suru vako ani tespaxi tw sadhai thamel gaye paxi ek choti tw janu nai parxa hahah.

                Riya didi ko bihe ma, timlai kurda kurda I started feeling anxious because you were taking so long to show up ani I also couldn't wait to see how you looked. When you finally arrived, my heart skipped a beat seeing how beautiful you looked 😍.
                
                We couldn't act like a couple since sabbai family haru hununthiyo, so hami group ma basyum tara timi hami sanga vanda sani sanga aajai basyo. Tarw ni, we were always next to each other and we talked through our eyes, shared quiet smiles, and spoke without really looking at each other. Ani aslo yo photo khichda I was a little scared timlai ni thaxa kina ki kasailey dhekxa vanera, but now this moment lives with us as a memory we won't forget 🥰.
